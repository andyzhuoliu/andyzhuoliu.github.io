Welcome to my homepage!
======
Hello, I'm Zhuo Liu (Andy), a student researcher at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Michael Manga](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/michael-manga) and Prof. [Madison Douglas](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/madison-douglas). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Geological Engineering and Mechanics from Lanzhou University in 2024, advised by Prof. [Xiaoyan Ye](https://gxyen.lzu.edu.cn/academics/associate-professors/2022/0125/191088.html) and Prof. [Sergio A. Galindo-Torres](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/sergio-torres.html) (Westlake University). I have also been fortunate to work with Prof. [Michael Lamb](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/michael-p-lamb) as a SURF Research Fellow at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)， Prof. [Judy Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/yang-judy) at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL), University of Minnesota and other impressive collaborations with Dr. Songkai Ren (Hangzhou Dianzi University), Dr. Guanlong Guo (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab) and Maria Schmeer (Caltech) during my undergrad.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
