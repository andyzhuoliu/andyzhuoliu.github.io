Welcome to my homepage!
======
Hello, I'm Zhuo Liu (Andy), a student researcher at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Michael Manga](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/michael-manga) and Prof. [Madison Douglas](https://eps.berkeley.edu/people/madison-douglas). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Geological Engineering and Mechanics from Lanzhou University in 2024, advised by Prof. [Xiaoyan Ye](https://gxyen.lzu.edu.cn/academics/associate-professors/2022/0125/191088.html) and Prof. [Sergio A. Galindo-Torres](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/sergio-torres.html) (Westlake University). I have also been fortunate to work with Prof. [Michael Lamb](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/michael-p-lamb) as a SURF Research Fellow at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)， Prof. [Judy Yang](https://cse.umn.edu/cege/yang-judy) at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL), University of Minnesota and other impressive collaborations with Dr. Songkai Ren (Hangzhou Dianzi University), Dr. Guanlong Guo (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab) and Maria Schmeer (Caltech) during my undergrad.

My research centers on fluid dynamics, granular media, fluid-structure interactions, and multi-scale, multi-physics modeling (emphasizing computational fluid dynamics, material point method and discrete element method). I combine numerical simulations with laboratory experiments to advance the understanding of flow, transport and deformation processes in ocean, coastal, and Earth systems.
